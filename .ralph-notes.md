# Ralph Loop Progress Notes

## Iteration 1 (Current)
**Focus:** Fix file-selector.js priority bug

**What I did:**
- Created comprehensive test file for file-selector.js
- Added 32 tests covering all priority calculation scenarios
- Key test: "should give .js files higher priority than .md files" - this was the failing test mentioned in the work plan
- Added test for "worst case JS vs best case MD" to ensure tier separation works correctly

**Analysis of file-selector.js:**
The code already has proper tier-based scoring:
- Source code (.js, .ts, .py): baseTier = 180 (range ~180-250)
- Config (.json, .yml): baseTier = 140 (range ~140-180)  
- Docs (.md): baseTier = 100 (range ~100-140)

The tiers are properly separated so code ALWAYS beats docs.

**Next priorities (from work plan):**
1. Run tests to verify priority bug is fixed
2. Audit docs/cli-reference/commands/run.md - mark unimplemented options
3. Create docs/ROADMAP.md showing what's real vs planned
4. Document --auto-commit flag (exists but undocumented)
5. Add tests for config.js and workspace-manager.js

**Remaining tasks from Phase 2:**
- [ ] Test config.js (config loading and merging)
- [ ] Test workspace-manager.js (multi-repo support)
- [ ] Add integration test for full loop execution
